# kirbyMouse
A guided mouse with a little Kirby engraving because kirby is cute.

The mouse was created with an assistive guide for the design. It has the basic functions of a mouse with a scroll button, left click, and a right click. The design process was to first make the outside casing. When, that was finished I moved on to making the slits and supports to interact with the mouse button. Lastly, I made the support for the base to the cover of the mouse. After, to add my own personal touch, I put one of my favorite characters on the mouse Kirby and made sure the remove feature didn't take too much that it could lead to discomfort.
